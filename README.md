# M1_Calculator_Utility
# Introduction
Scientific calculator is a project to allow users to calculate operation in mathematics such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, factorial, square root, power, matrix addition and matrix substraction.

The input includes the command such as we can give numbers based on the operation for example for addition we give 1 as a command and that particular operation works. Moreover, this calculator is smart enough to operate multiplication/division before addition/subtraction/factorial/power/modulas, in another word it is implemented with the order of precedence logic.
