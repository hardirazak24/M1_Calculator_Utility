# Requirements
## Introduction
Scientific calculator is a project to allow users to calculate operation in mathematics such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, factorial, square root, power, matrix addition and matrix substraction.

The input includes the command such as we can give numbers based on the operation for example for addition we give 1 as a command and that particular operation works. Moreover, this calculator is smart enough to operate multiplication/division before addition/subtraction/factorial/power/modulas, in another word it is implemented with the order of precedence logic.

## High Level Requirements
* User should be able to review operation menu
* The user should be able to select the operation
* The system should be able to perform the given operation
* The system should provide correct result

## Low Level Requirements
* Menu Should e displayed
* Program should exit when user enter's zero
* Action executed according to the input given
* Appropriate error messages at failure and success of operations

## SWOT
#### STRENGTHS

The ultimate strength Calculators is its innovative,user-friendly and long lasting etc..

### WEAKNESSES

Do not inlude all the operations rather have onlty addition,subtraction multiplication, division ,modulas ,power and factorial.

### OPPORTUNITIES

The tech-based market has a huge opportunities in capturing the youth market. And this calculator comparatively already one step ahead than other

### THREATS

The slower growth in technological innovation will also bring a significant threat in the upcoming dynamic world.
