# Requirements
## Introduction
Mathematical operations are a part of our daily lives. Everyday we will be involving with various types of calculations around us. Scientific calculator is a project to allow users to calculate operation in mathematics such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, factorial, square root, power, matrix addition and matrix substraction.
The input includes the command such as we can give numbers based on the operation for example for addition we give 1 as a command and that particular operation works. Moreover, this calculator is smart enough to operate multiplication/division before addition/subtraction/factorial/power/modulas, in another word it is implemented with the order of precedence logic.

## High Level Requirements
* User should be able to review operation menu
* The user should be able to select the operation
* The system should be able to perform the given operation
* The system should provide correct result

## Low Level Requirements
* Menu Should e displayed
* Program should exit when user enter's zero
* Action executed according to the input given
* Appropriate error messages at failure and success of operations

## 4W's and 1'H
### Who:
* All the students and employess who requires the calculations will use the program to find their answer. The main objective of this project is that user should be satisfied with freindly interface and fast calculation
### What:
* Calculate the mathematical operation such as Addition, Substraction, Multiplication, Division, power, squareroot, logarithm and Matrix addition and substraction.
* It's free and can be easily used by people of all ages
### When:
* Students facing a difficulty in solving a mathematical problem, can use this program to confirm their outputs.
* Researchers can use it for getting a quick calculation output.
### Where:
* In all the Domains it can be used
* Students, employees and researchers from all over the world.
### How:
* This program can be executed in a system which has Linux or Windows operating system.
* The Project is going to be implemented in C language
* The constraints of the project are to develop it using industry level standards with a multi-file approach.
