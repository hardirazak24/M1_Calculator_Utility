# Requirements
## Introduction
* Mathematical operations are a part of our daily lives. Everyday we will be involving with various types of calculations around us. A Scientific calculator is a device which can perform some mathematical operations like arthmetic operations & scinetific operations i.e here In this project we are going to implement some calculator operations using C Language. 
* This calculator can perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, factorial, square root, power, matrix addition and matrix substraction.

## Research
This Calculator doesn't involve any complex operations. It is easy to apply the values in this program to find the result rather than remembering and applying it in formula. Thus by studying all these facts, the necessary functions has been implemented to get the required results in a better way.

## Cost and Features
The cost for implementing this project is minimal to none

## SWOT Analysis

## 4W's and 1'H
### Who:
* All the students and employess who requires the calculations will use the program to find their answer. The main objective of this project is that user should be satisfied with freindly interface and fast calculation
### What:
* Calculate the mathematical operation such as Addition, Substraction, Multiplication, Division, power, squareroot, logarithm and Matrix addition and substraction.
* It's free and can be easily used by people of all ages
### When:
* Students facing a difficulty in solving a mathematical problem, can use this program to confirm their outputs.
* Researchers can use it for getting a quick calculation output.
### Where:
* In all the Domains it can be used
* Students, employees and researchers from all over the world.
### How:
* This program can be executed in a system which has Linux or Windows operating system.
* The Project is going to be implemented in C language
* The constraints of the project are to develop it using industry level standards with a multi-file approach.
